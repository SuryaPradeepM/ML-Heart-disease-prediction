# ML-Heart-disease-prediction
We Explore the UCI-Heart Dataset to identify correlations among the variables, Perform Preprocessing, and apply various Machine Learning algorithms along with some parameter tuning and later, comparing the Performance of Machine Learning Algorithms in Cardiovascular Disease prediction as part of our Final Year Project
